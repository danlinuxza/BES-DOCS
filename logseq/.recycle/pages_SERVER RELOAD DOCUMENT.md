## Important Points to
Remember:  









<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->A SITE
UNABLE TO TRADE TAKES PRIORITY OVER ALL ISSUES (As many tills as possible
must be open, opening only one till is not acceptable.)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Whoever
receives a reload will need to complete the reload. (When taking on a
reload you agree to working overtime should there be a need for it.)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->If there
is no connection to the site that is to be reloaded the person responsible will
need to Ensure by all means that the connection is restored ASAP (Even if
the Client has to get the manager to return to site)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Do not
allow a technician to reload a server over the weekend unless it is in a
critical state – Do not begin a reload after 5pm (Critical meaning that a
site has been unable to process EOD for a DAY – our SLA for Server reloads is 4
hours)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->If a site is able to function normally and
process EOD it will not be considered Critical.



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Manager\Senior on duty to be kept up to date
timeously on the status of the reload



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Any
issues which occur are to be escalated after minimal investigation has been
done. (Please do not keep an issue for more than an hour before escalating)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Before a technician goes to site Person
responsible for the reload will run through the “Questions to Ask Technician
and Advices”



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->If during
a reload any errors occur, continue the reload until completion and
investigate/Escalate thereafter - (Do not go back and try re-installing any
steps. This could cause even more problems.)



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Make sure
before performing the reload that the Server has been reloaded. It is possible
that the server could have been pre–staged. (Check for SQL; POS Server; JRE
icons are running on the bottom right of the server’s screen as signs of the
server being reloaded and check the \server\safe directory for files older than
the day the Server was reloaded to confirm if it had been pre-staged. 



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->Remember EACH reload is different and there is
always a possibility that something will go wrong. 



<!--[if !supportLists]-->-       
<!--[endif]-->It Never hurts to ask for assistance.
