Hi,

Attached is a batch file to copy data with the same date from one directory to another.

First rename the file from cdat.txt to cdat.bat

How to use batch:

Copy to c:\nds of store.

You need to put in the directory you copying from, the directory you copying to and the date you want to copy.

Eg:cdat c:\nds\posdata\safe c:\nds\24-11 01/10/2013
